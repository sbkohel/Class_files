To import the information from the spreadsheet we developed a Java program to read in the information into various data structures.  The identifying vernacular for the AI and criteria was not present for all items.  To compensate for this we split some of the string up in order to have identifying id's for all items.  We also used string splitting to ensure that all data had a uniform consistency.  Once all the data was prepared, a series of printwriters were used output the proper sql commands to insert that data into the proper tables.
