		<p>While I was eating a piece of cheese fell on the floor.  A mouse that was nearby came and started to eat the cheese.  A cat saw the mouse out of the corner of its eye, and started to chase the mouse.  The mouse was very fast and stayed ahead of the mouse quite easily, and ran underneath a small table.  The cat bumped into the table which had a glass of water on it.  The glass tipped over and spilled on a large dog.  When the dog got wet it jumped up and attacked the cat.</p>
